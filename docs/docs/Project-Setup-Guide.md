# Project Setup Guide

To run either the Docusaurus or Next.js project locally, first pull the files from the github repository found [here](https://github.com/ACIERNO-CS/token-project).

To run a local instance of this project, simply replace the CoinGecko DEMO_KEY in web-app/src/fetch/coin.js and run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Otherwise, an instance is currently hosted [here](https://token-project-production.onrender.com/).

The Docusaurus project can be run similarly, by calling
```bash
npm install
npm run start
```
